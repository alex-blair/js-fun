# js-fun

This project was built as part of a creative assignment for Sprint 9, Phase 0 of EDA's bootcamp. I kind of went a bit too far down the rabbit hole on this one, trying to include lots of little details. It was supposed to take 6 hours to build... Well, at least it's working now (though the rabbit can only go on his adventure twice before certain things stop appearing. If anyone wants to try and fix that feel free!). The quotes are from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll (tweaked slightly in parts).
