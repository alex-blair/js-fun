# js-fun

This project was built as part of a creative assignment for Sprint 9, Phase 0 of EDA's bootcamp. I kind of went a bit too far down the rabbit hole on this one, trying to include lots of little details and breaking everything in the process. It was supposed to take 6 hours to build... Well, at least it's not broken anymore (though the rabbit can only go on his adventure twice before certain things stop appearing. If anyone wants to fix that feel free!)
